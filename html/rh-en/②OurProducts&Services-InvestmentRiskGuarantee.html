									<h5 class="des_tit">Alleviating risk of overseas resource development investment</h5>
									In general, with an overseas resource development business, a high level of investment return can be
									expected. However, it is a high risk, high return business involving long-term and large-scale
									investment and uncertainty of future returns. Investment risk guarantee partially compensates for the
									losses suffered by investors, and thereby alleviates the risk of investment losses associated with
									overseas resource development investment activities.
								</div>
								<div class="des_list des_risk02">
									<h5 class="des_tit">Activating overseas resource development fund</h5>
									Investment transactions for overseas resource development require professional knowledge and skills
									for the market forecast of the resources and business feasibility assessment for the mine lots
									concerned. Accordingly, investments are limitedly carried out by professional companies (E&P
									companies, etc.). By alleviating the risks associated with overseas resource development investment,
									investment risk guarantee contributes to creating an overseas resource development fund market where
									not only professionals, but also general investors can perform investment activities safely. In other
									words, investment risk guarantee promotes the activation of overseas resource development funds
									through participation by not only professional companies, but also general investors, as it helps
									nonprofessionals gain investment returns from overseas resource development business.
								</div>
								<div class="des_list des_risk03">
									<h5 class="des_tit">Serving as policy for investment risk guarantee</h5>
									Investment risk guarantee is operated with the government’s support to stably secure key resources,
									such as petroleum, by promoting overseas resource development funds and investment transactions for
									overseas resource development. Under the goal to achieve the long-term balance of payments, it adopts
									the lowest possible insurance rates and a high compensation limit, etc., which are advantageous for
									investors, and therefore contributes to creating a financial market for investment in overseas
									resource development. In other words, through the long-term and stable supply of key raw and
									subsidiary materials necessary for domestic industrial development, such as petroleum (gas), coal,
									iron, copper, and zinc, by activating investment transactions for overseas resource development, it
									pursues the policy goal to develop the national economy.
