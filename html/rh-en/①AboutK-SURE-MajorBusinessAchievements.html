						<div class="sub_section">
							<h5 class="sub_tit">A Total of KRW 165.1 trillion in Support with Record-High Support to SMEs at KRW 59.6
								trillion</h5>
							Despite the initially grim outlook on export due to the COVID-19 pandemic and US-China trade dispute,
							K-SURE provided KRW 165.1 trillion in support to promote trade and overseas investment, with its support
							to SMEs reaching a record-high level at KRW 59.6 trillion.
						</div>
						<div class="sub_section">
							<h5 class="sub_tit">Full-Fledged Support for Export in Response to COVID-19</h5>
							<p>K-SURE launched the COVID-19 Response Task Force (TF) to deal with the challenges presented by the
								unprecedented global health crisis. In order to provide full-fledged support for exporters by mobilizing
								all its resources, the TF was restructured into the K-SURE Emergency Business Management Team headed by
								the Chairman and President of K-SURE and comprised of the directors of all the divisions.</p>
							<p class="txt_margin">In addition to implementing the measures to reinvigorating export announced by the
								government at the 4th Emergency Economic Council Meeting, K-SURE developed the Guidelines on Full-Fledge
								Trade Insurance Support to Minimize the Damage from COVID-19, extended insurance policies without
								lowering the credit line and provided KRW 37.4 trillion in liquidity through the Emergency Export
								Stabilization Funds to assist exporters among SMEs.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="sub_section">
							<h5 class="sub_tit">Improvement of the Digital Trade Insurance Platform</h5>
							K-SURE’s launch of the Online Direct Guarantee and Online Direct Insurance for improved user convenience
							was met with high customer satisfaction and viewed as an excellent example of digital innovation in the
							industry. By expanding the scope of online services and automating the review procedure by linking
							databases with relevant institutions, K-SURE successfully laid the groundwork for the digitization of
							trade insurance.
