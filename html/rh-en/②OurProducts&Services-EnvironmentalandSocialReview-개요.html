							<h4>What is Environmental and Social Review?</h4>
							<p>
								K-SURE provides financial support for medium and long-term export projects of Korean companies. The
								medium and long-term projects K-SURE provides financial support for bring economic benefits to the
								importing countries. However, these can also exert environmental and social impacts.
							</p>
							<p>
								To this end, K-SURE, according to the OECD Recommendation of the Council on Common Approaches for
								Officially Supported Export Credits and Environmental and Social Due Diligence, assesses the
								environmental and social impact and ensures preparation of measures to reduce such impacts when
								providing financial support for medium and long-term projects, and therefore ultimately contributes to
								sustainable development.
							</p>
							<p>
								Environmental and social review is a series of processes to assess the environmental and social impact
								and appropriateness of measures to reduce the impact based on the environmental and social impact
								assessment report and environmental and social management plan, etc.

								<li>
									<h5 class="cate_a">Category A</h5>
									A project is classified as Category A if it has the potential to have significant adverse
									environmental and/or social impacts, which are diverse, irreversible and/or unprecedented. These
									impacts may affect an area broader than the sites or facilities subject to physical works. Category A,
									in principle, includes projects in sensitive sectors or located in or near sensitive areas.
								</li>
								<li>
									<h5 class="cate_b">Category B</h5>
									A project is classified as Category B if its potential environmental and/or social impacts are less
									adverse than those of Category A projects. Typically, these impacts are few in number, site-specific,
									few if any are irreversible, and mitigation measures are more readily available.
								<li>
									<h5 class="cate_c">Category C</h5>
									A project is classified as Category C if it has minimal or no potentially adverse environmental and/or
									social impacts.
