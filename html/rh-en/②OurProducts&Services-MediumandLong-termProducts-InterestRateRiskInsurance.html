							<h4 class="tit">Overview of Scheme</h4>
							This scheme is to compensate for losses suffered by financial institutes that provided export finance with
							a repayment period of at least two years and are covered by K-SURE’s medium and long-term export credit
							insurance (buyer credit) according to interest rate fluctuations, and to redeem gains of the financial
							institutes.
							<ul class="list shape_type1 sm-mt-5 lg-mt-10">
								<li>To improve the capacity of Korean companies to secure orders for medium and long-term export
									transactions on deferred payment basis, such as for petrochemical and power generation facilities, it
									is necessary to have financial institutes offering loan products with better conditions participate in
									the transactions, in addition to the companies’ providing competitive export products and prices.
									However, the OECD has established the principle to set the minimum interest rate provided to buyers as
									CIRR in order to prevent excessive competition among member states in international competitive
									bidding.</li>
								<li>The issue is that not only the number of financial institutes capable of providing export finance on
									the condition of CIRR is limited, but also commercial banks prefer loans with variable interest rates
									while buyers prefer loans with fixed interest rates.</li>
								<li>Interest rate risk insurance has been introduced to resolve the differences in interests between
									financial contract parties, and ensure successful use of export finance by companies.</li>

							<h4 class="tit">Effect of Interest Rate Risk Insurance</h4>
							Importers (borrowers) can take out loans on the basis of CIRR, the minimum fixed interest rate, permitted
							by the OECD Arrangement.
							<div class="mt-10">Lenders (financial institutes) can stably enjoy gains for the spread as guaranteed by
								K-SURE while hedging interest rate risks associated with borrowing on variable interest rates and loans
